## R Packages

### [fancycut](https://github.com/adamleerich/fancycut)

My package on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fancycut/index.html).
Despite the name, it is nothing fancy.
It provides the function `fancycut()` which is like `base::cut()`
except you can mix left open and right open intervals with point values,
intervals that are closed on both ends, and intervals that are open on both ends
using notation that is unambiguous.




### [alrtools](https://github.com/adamleerich/alrtools)

I've written a bunch of simple utility functions for R over the years and keep them in this pacakge.
There isn't a strong theme, there are probably better alternatives out there,
and I am not so worried about portability.
Therefore, it is not on CRAN and never will be.
But, it has some really useful things that I am dependent on.
All the code is licensed under `CC0` so feel free to take it and build something better!




### [alr3-aa1f43f9](https://github.com/adamleerich/alr3-aa1f43f9)

Snatch-and-grab of [cran/alr3](https://github.com/cran/alr3) at commit `aa1f43f9`.
This appears to the last commit before the authors started deprecating parts of the package.
`alr3` is an old R package that is no longer on CRAN.
It is a companion to the textbook by S. Weisberg _Applied Linear Regression, 3rd edition_.
I'm keeping this copy because sometimes I see texts or tutorials that refer to it.
If you need the package, you can download this and build it locally.




## Study Support

Some of my public repos are collections of notes I keep while learning something new.
There isn't anything here that you can use out-of-the-box.

## IPO eminent

### :lips: [bushes-of-love](https://github.com/adamleerich/bushes-of-love) :lips:
This repo is private for now, but I am really excited about the idea.
This will be a Windows service and Linux daemon that is watching out for things I think are important: configurations not changing, registry entries, environment variables, etc.
Named for the [song on Youtube](https://youtu.be/RySHDUU2juM).
The [wired-060511](https://github.com/adamleerich/wired-060511) repo has code that might be helpful for this project.



### [connecticut-birds](https://github.com/adamleerich/connecticut-birds)

I want to write a book about birds in Connecticut and how to recognize them by their songs.
But, instead of the typical text descriptions that are in most birding books,
I'd like to focus on using an unambiguous notation for collecting and comparing bird songs,
following the examples on [earbirding.com](https://earbirding.com/blog/archives/category/describing-sounds).
I've got bad eyesight and colorblindness, so ear birding is appealing.




### [notes](https://github.com/adamleerich/notes)

I love Rene Nyffenegger's [notes](https://renenyffenegger.ch/notes/index.html) part of his webpage
and I want to do something similar,
but for the stuff that I am constantly looking up.



### [chessobscura.com](https://github.com/adamleerich/chessobscura.com)

HFS this is going to be awesome.
To quote Ruth, ["I don't know **** about ****"](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/84712520/i-dont-know-shit-about-fuck.jpg)
when it come to chess, but why not write *the* definitive website on the topic?
